# aims-til
Various utilities for dealing with meshes

**This project is now obsolete**

The branch 5.0 is still used in releases 5.0.x of BrainVisa (https://brainvisa.info), but later ones (from 5.1, the current master) will not use it any longer.

Used parts of aims-til have been integrated in aims-free (VertexRemover and meshCleaner command) or were already existing there (distance maps on meshes, KD-tree), and code using them have been adapted to use aims-free instead.
